# opspark
A node utility supporting installation and configuration of operation spark projects.

## Installation

## Usage

1. To get a list of installable projects, run:

    You'll be presented with a list of installable projects:

2. Select the project you want to install using the arrow keys

3. Once you've selected the project using the arrow keys, press `Return`.  You'll then be asked to confirm:

    Press enter to confirm, and the installation will take place:

...and when complete, you'll see the message:

You're ready to roll!  To begin working on our project, typically you will go into the directory of the project you just installed (for example, `frabonacci`), and open the file `index.html`.  Again, if you installed the **frabonacci** project, you'll open the `index.html` file at:

    frabonacci/index.html

Have fun!
